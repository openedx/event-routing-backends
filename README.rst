Various backends for retransmitting edX LMS events to external services.

Overview
--------

event-routing-backends contains plugins for the `event-tracking`_ app that is installed as a part of edx-platform. It provides a backend that can take events and re-transmit them to external services.  It also provides some new processers that can convert edx-platform events into other formats.

Currently work to support xAPI and Caliper event formats is in progress.

See `OEP 26`_ for background; the xAPI and Caliper subdocuments in particular include a specification of how LMS events will be translated to the format of the respective protocols.
